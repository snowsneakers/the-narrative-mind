          I am a dedicated and compassionate therapist who believes in the
          unique and irreplaceable nature of the therapeutic relationship. My
          approach to therapy is characterized by warmth, collaboration, and a
          commitment to providing a non-pathologizing space for exploration. In
          my practice, I believe that every emotion and behavior makes sense in
          context. I am passionate about helping my clients understand their
          experiences, both past and present, and supporting them in letting go
          of parts that no longer serve them.

          Together, we delve into the stories we carry, seeking to understand
          how they shape our present realities. By examining larger systems that
          impact us, we can gain insight into the roots of our challenges and
          work towards meaningful change.

          If you are seeking a therapist who values the uniqueness of your

          understanding, growth, and meaningful change.
